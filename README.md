# Kaikanes Portfolio
***
Hello and welcome to my Portfolio. This single page application uses React and is used to showcase some of my work. There are four sections that can be traversed through the nav-bar at the top first of witch is the About Me, a short description about me. The second is my Portfolio tab which showcases my projects with links to repositorys and the live application. The last two sections are my Resume and Contact pages where you can download my resume and send me an email. At the bottom in the footer section of all the pages I have icons linking to my linkedin github and blank profiles so feel free to check those out aswell. Thank you for your interest and happy coding!
